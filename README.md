# Instructions for setting up the game

To play the game, a PC, mobile phone (running Android 13+), and skateboard are required. The game is intended to be played with a skateboard, but if none is available, the user can hold the phone in their hand and tilt it.  
Make sure that the game is allowed through the firewall and that the current network is set to private instead of public (on the PC).  
Install the APK on your phone (this will probably require giving your file browser app of choice permission to install APKs), run it, and click "Find". Hopefully, an IP address should pop up in the drop-down menu below. If it has, click connect.  
If no IP address is shown, there are a few possible solutions:
1. Check if both devices are on the same network and check that the game is allowed through the firewall on your PC
2. If the PC being used is connected to the phone's mobile hotspot, change the IP address selected in the top drop-down menu to the phone's IP on the hotspot.
3. Attempt to manually input the PC's IP address (use "ipaddr" in the command prompt in Windows to find your IP) into the IP Address field and then click "Add".
